John grew up in a small mining town where his father died in a tragic mine collapse when he was only 8 years old. This early loss shaped his entire worldview. He learned early that authority figures and corporate executives lie to protect themselves, not the workers who risk their lives daily.

He believes deeply that the system is fundamentally rigged against ordinary working people. Despite witnessing corruption and exploitation throughout his youth, he never trusted anyone in a position of power. This distrust became a core part of his identity.

Despite his cynicism about the system, John dreams of becoming a union organizer to fight for workers' rights and safety regulations. He wants to prevent other children from losing their fathers the way he did. His greatest ambition is to create real change in labor laws.

He fears being powerless and ineffective, just like his father was. John assumes that people in authority will always prioritize profit over human life, and that the only way to create change is through organized resistance and collective action.
